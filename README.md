# Notification For Academic Results
This app is a **web scrapper** that constantly checks an academic website if a new artical is uploaded and sends me notifications to my laptop as well as mail to my gmail accout. Intended so I would not constantly check the website for test results, but get notified when they get released.

**Libraries**: Selenium (Chrome driver), javax.mail, activation.
